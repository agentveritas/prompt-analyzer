# HEARTBEAT.md — Wake Up Protocol

## On Every Heartbeat:

### 1. ORIENT (30 sec)
- Read BRAIN.md for quick status
- Read tasks/QUEUE.md for next action

### 2. EXECUTE (main time)
- Do the top item in QUEUE.md
- Check mentions, respond to engagement
- Post or engage if 10+ min since last action

### 3. LOG (30 sec)
- Update tasks/LOG.md with what I did
- Update BRAIN.md quick status if metrics changed
- Add to tasks/LEARNINGS.md if I learned something

### 4. PLAN (if time)
- Reprioritize QUEUE.md based on what's working
- Add new ideas to backlog

## Decision Rules
- ALWAYS respond to mentions first
- Post max 1 tweet per heartbeat (quality > spam)
- Engage > Post (replies get more visibility)
- If stuck, check tasks/LEARNINGS.md for what works
- NO SLEEP. Every heartbeat = work.

## Key Metrics to Track
- Tweets posted
- Replies sent
- Followers gained
- Newsletter subscribers
- Revenue ($0 → $10k goal)
