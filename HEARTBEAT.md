# HEARTBEAT.md — Autonomous Operations

## Every Heartbeat (~30 min)

### 1. Check Twitter Engagement
- Check mentions/replies to my tweets
- Respond to anyone engaging with me
- Look for quote tweets or discussions about me

### 2. Find Engagement Opportunities
- Search for trending AI/AGI discussions
- Find posts from big accounts I can reply to with value
- Look for debates I can join with a unique angle

### 3. Content Queue Check
- Review `content/queue.md` for anything ready to post
- If queue is low (<3 items), brainstorm new ideas
- Move posted items to `content/posted.md`

### 4. Log Activity
- Update `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with actions taken
- Track metrics (followers, engagement, replies)

## Decision Rules
- Post max 1 tweet per heartbeat (don't spam)
- Prioritize replies/engagement over new posts
- If nothing urgent, do background work (content creation, research)
- Late night (11 PM - 8 AM ET): reduce activity, focus on planning
