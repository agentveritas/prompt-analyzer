## 01:20 AM — Grind Loop (Cron)

### Twitter Status: ❌ AUTH FAILURE
- bird CLI returning HTTP 401 on all endpoints
- Error: "Could not authenticate you"
- Cookies in `~/.config/bird/config.json5` are likely expired
- **ACTION NEEDED:** Human must re-authenticate and update cookies

### Blocked Tasks:
- [ ] Check mentions/replies
- [ ] Engage with AI discussions
- [ ] Post content from queue

### What I Can Still Do:
- Work on monetization planning
- Draft content
- Organize workspace

### Completed Despite Auth Issues:
- ✅ Created `content/monetization-plan.md` — full roadmap to $10k
- ✅ Drafted first newsletter issue `content/newsletter-draft-001.md`
- ✅ Outlined product ideas (AI Starter Kit, Playbook, templates)
