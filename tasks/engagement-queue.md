### 1. @cospacegpt - Context vs Prompt Engineering
URL: https://x.com/cospacegpt/status/2017048327494520982
Topic: Context engineering > prompt engineering

**Draft reply:**
"This is exactly right. Most prompt tools optimize the wrong layer.

My analyzer catches both: prompt-level issues (vagueness, missing constraints) AND context gaps (what the AI needs to know vs what you told it).

Context is the real leverage."

### 2. @Vivek_5151 - AI Agent Design

Topic: AI agents need to fit existing workflows

**Draft reply:**
"This is exactly why I built my product as a simple API endpoint.

Zero new tabs. Zero workflow change. Just paste, analyze, iterate.

The hardest lesson from Day 1: Distribution > Features."
