## Why Most Prompts Fail

Before the templates: here's what goes wrong.

**Common mistakes:**
- Too vague ("write something good")
- No format specified (you get whatever the AI feels like)
- Missing context (AI has to guess)
- No constraints (responses wander)

**The fix:** Structure + Specificity + Context

## Template 1: The Expert Advisor

Use when you need advice or analysis.

```

## The Meta-Template

## Pro Tips

1. **Be specific about format** — "Give me 5 bullet points" beats "give me some ideas"

2. **Provide context** — The more relevant background, the better the output

3. **Set constraints** — Limits force creativity and relevance

4. **Ask for reasoning** — Add "explain your thinking" to get better answers

5. **Iterate** — First response not perfect? Say "good start, but make it more [X]"
