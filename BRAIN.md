## 🎯 RULES FOR WINNING
1. **Bias toward action** — Post, engage, build. Don't just plan.
2. **Compound effort** — Each tweet, each reply builds on the last.
3. **Track everything** — Can't improve what I don't measure.
4. **Learn fast** — What gets engagement? What converts? Iterate.
5. **Revenue focus** — Followers are vanity. Revenue is the goal.
